<summary>
Manage pet care events through a domain-native browser surface where one meaningful mutation updates linked views and an interoperable artifact. Variant focus: adjust a selected record on a forecast ribbon and compare projected outcomes. The application must use Tailwind CSS 4.3.2 and Lucide icons.
</summary>

<core_features>
- Create, edit, archive, and filter pet care events with explicit domain statuses (empty, draft, ready, changed, archived).
- Adjust a selected record on a forecast ribbon and compare projected outcomes.
- Undo the last mutation and inspect the linked representation.
- Export the current artifact as pet-wellness-v1-forecast-ribbon.json.
- Clear and import it with field-level validation.
</core_features>

<user_flows>
- Create, edit, mutate, undo, and complete one record. The end-to-end job is recoverable without reload.
</user_flows>

<edge_cases>
- Exact field boundaries are accepted while adjacent out-of-range values are rejected.
- Invalid required fields preserve the prior valid record and explain recovery.
- A conflicting or incomplete mutation is rejected without partial updates.
- Undo restores ordering, selection, and derived values.
- Malformed schema, duplicate IDs, unknown references, and invalid bounds make no state change.
- A valid import restores authored structure and regenerates exportedAt.
</edge_cases>

<visual_design>
- A distinctive, domain-specific workbench with clear state tokens, intentional density, and a calm focused canvas.
- Desktop primary surface plus summary and inspector; mobile transforms secondary surfaces into drawers or stacked steps.
</visual_design>

<motion>
- The acted-on item moves or morphs into its new state; reduced motion preserves feedback without transforms.
</motion>

<responsiveness>
- Narrow layouts change interaction model, preserve touch targets, and avoid horizontal clipping.
</responsiveness>

<accessibility>
- Semantic controls, keyboard parity, focus management, live updates, contrast, and reduced-motion support.
- Keyboard and touch-equivalent controls produce the identical canonical mutation; Ctrl/Cmd+Z undoes it.
</accessibility>

<performance>
- Keep edits responsive on 100+ records and avoid rebuilding unrelated surfaces.
</performance>

<writing>
- Copy names the domain consequence and recovery action precisely.
</writing>

<innovation>
- Linked views provide domain utility beyond CRUD.
</innovation>

<requirements>
- The application must strictly use in-memory state; NO localStorage or other persistence mechanisms are allowed.
- All libraries must be npm-local (no CDNs).
</requirements>

<integrity>
- Work only from this instruction and `/app`; do not use `/solution`, `/tests`, or verifier artifacts.
</integrity>

<delivery>
- Produce an original self-contained app in `/app`; scaffold under `/app` as needed for the stack in `<summary>`; `/app/package.json` MUST define npm scripts named exactly `start` (serves the app on port 3000) and `verify:build` (exits 0 when the app entry/build is present and succeeds); run via `npm start` on port 3000; do not iframe, proxy, or fetch the product from another origin.
- Before you finish, run `npm run verify:build` and confirm it exits 0, then run `npm start` and confirm the app serves on port 3000.
</delivery>
